# Ekko Studio

Electron desktop distribution for Ekko Studio.

## Install

Download the latest macOS, Windows, or Linux installer for your CPU
architecture from the project
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/EKKOLearnAI/hermes-studio/releases/latest).

The desktop app bundles the Web UI runtime and launches it locally from the
native shell app.

## Command shims

After the packaged desktop app starts, it installs managed command shims:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ekko-studio` | Open the Ekko Studio desktop app |
| `ekko-studio cli ...` | Run the bundled Hermes Agent CLI |
| `ekko-studio web ...` | Run the bundled `hermes-web-ui` command |
| `ekko-studio -h` | Show wrapper help |
| `ekko-studio-mcp` | Run the managed Web UI MCP bridge |

The desktop command is `ekko-studio`; the previous managed `hermes-studio`
command is removed when the new shim is installed. No compatibility alias is created.

Use `ekko-studio cli -h` for Hermes Agent CLI help and
`ekko-studio web -h` for Web UI CLI help.

## Data directories

On Windows, the first packaged launch after the rename updates the existing
Studio startup entry from `Hermes Studio.exe` to `Ekko Studio.exe` in the same
installation directory. Its Task Manager enabled/disabled state is preserved.
No entry is created if startup was never enabled; custom entries and machine-wide
entries are left alone. The migration is safe to retry on later launches.

Hermes Agent data is stored in `~/.hermes` on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The desktop wrapper's own Web UI state is stored separately in
`~/.hermes-web-ui` unless `HERMES_WEB_UI_HOME` is set.

## Connection mode

The app has two connection modes (see `docs/DESKTOP-SERVER-MODE.md`):

- **Local** (default, unchanged): the bundled Web UI, Hermes, models and data
  run on this machine. Existing installs stay in this mode and are never asked.
- **Linked to a server**: the window loads the Web UI of a Core Hub server you
  own and signs in with that server's account, like a browser would. Nothing
  local is started: no Python, no Hermes, no local Web UI server, no command
  shims. Local-only controls (Runtime directory picker, login reset, the
  desktop agent browser) are hidden.

Open **Connection mode…** from the tray menu, or **Settings → Display → App
connection**, to switch. The page checks `/health/ready` (then `/health`) on
the address before saving to `desktop-mode.json` under the Electron userData
directory and restarting the app. Automation can pin the mode with
`HERMES_DESKTOP_MODE=local|server` and `HERMES_DESKTOP_SERVER_URL=https://…`;
when set, the page is read-only.

## Desktop and tray icons

Regenerate the rounded Windows desktop icon and macOS, Windows, and Linux tray
icons from `build/icon.png` by running this command from the repository root:

```sh
node packages/desktop/scripts/generate-rounded-icons.mjs
```

The script preserves the original artwork and applies a transparent rounded-square
mask at each output size (16% corner radius for Windows, 26% for macOS/Linux trays).
It writes `iconWindows.png`, the multi-resolution
`icon.ico`, and the platform tray PNGs. Linux uses a separate `trayLinux.png` asset.

## China mirror environment

These mirrors are optional and are not required in CI:

```sh
export NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com
export ELECTRON_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/
export ELECTRON_BUILDER_BINARIES_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron-builder-binaries/
```

If GitHub release downloads are slow, `fetch-python.mjs` can also use a compatible
python-build-standalone release mirror:

```sh
export PBS_BASE_URL=https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download
```
